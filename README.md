<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

## 📖 Leaderboard <a name="about-project"></a>

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) that interacts with a Leaderboard API to display a list of players' names and scores. Users can add new players' scores to the list, which is then stored in the API.

The project uses Webpack for bundling and optimizing code. Webpack allows you to combine all your JavaScript modules into a single file, reducing the number of HTTP requests required to load a web page. This results in a faster and more responsive web page for users.

The project is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience for those interested in learning about APIs, Git workflow, and Webpack. Through this project, users will learn how to fetch data from a remote server, manipulate the DOM to display the data, and send data back to the server to be stored. They will also learn how to use Git for version control, including creating and managing branches, committing changes, and merging them back into the main branch.

Overall, this project is a great way to gain practical experience in web development and gain valuable knowledge that can be applied to other projects in the future.
